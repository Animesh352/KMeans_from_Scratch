# K-Means Algorithm from Scratch on Online Retail Dataset

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that applies the K-Means clustering algorithm from scratch on the Online Retail Dataset. The project aims to demonstrate how K-Means can be implemented and used to segment customers based on their purchasing patterns.

## Contents
- **Introduction**: Provides an overview of the project and outlines the objectives of using the K-Means clustering algorithm on the Online Retail Dataset.
- **Importing Libraries**: Contains code snippets for importing necessary Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Scipy.
- **Dataset Insights**: Includes code for data importation, summary, exploration, and preprocessing steps such as handling null values, duplicates, and understanding data distribution.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Discusses normalization techniques like Z-score normalization and Box-Cox transformation, which are crucial for preparing the dataset for clustering.
- **Model Creation**: Offers a detailed explanation and implementation of the K-Means algorithm from scratch, including its mathematical foundations.
- **Model Evaluation**: Provides methods and code snippets for evaluating the effectiveness of the clustering.
